In regards to the developmental process there are not many anticipated problems. However, we understand that challenges may arise throughout the creation process. A possible technical challenge is the implementation from mathematical principles into computational formats. Alongside this is becoming proficient with Shell. We do not foresee challenges regarding the developmental process as our schedules align and are in agreement about communication and workflow. In terms of a challenge in team composition, there certainly is a discrepancy in technical skills and competency, however, we see this as complimentary of our collaboration and composition.
