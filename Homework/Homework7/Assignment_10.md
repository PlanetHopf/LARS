## Project description
*A brief description of why you wrote the code, what problem it is trying to address, and anything else you think is relevant to know about your project. This should be about 100 words.*

The manual collecting and sorting of articles presents significant problems in the scholarly world. These problems are a lack of organization in the collection and relevance of articles in the research process, the misrepresentation of an articleâ€™s meaning, and standardization in the formatting and style for publications. Thus, the purpose of this project is to create a workshop to gain familiarity with github and git to that end. As such, the code here is very basic, to handle a simple collection of references, store that in some place, and process it for readiability. In no wise, is the expectation of this code, or rather workshop intended for anything else.

## List of must-have features of your project including their status
*Were you able to complete all basic features? If not, why not? This list should match the list you submitted in assignment 2.*
 1. Get articles and abstracts
 2. Read and sort articles and abstracts by keywords
 3. Output relevant groupings and statistics

## List of nice-to-have features of your project including their status
*This list should have at least all features you included in assignment 2, but could have more if you added new features along the way. Nice-to-have features do not have to be completed. They may be in progress or not done yet.*
 1. Create centralized location for sources
 2. Create useful visualizations and identifiers of relevant groupings and statistics
 3. Automate creation of text files from URL

## A reflection of your work on the project.
*The reflection should be about a page long. It should answer the following questions*:
 - *What processes, tools, technologies, and workflows worked well for your team? How did they improve or simplify your team work?*
 
 - *What processes, tools, technologies, and workflows did not work well and why?* 
 
 - *If you would start over, what would you change and why?*
 
 - *If you kept working on the project, what would be the next step in its development?*
 
 - *Does your code meet the FAIR4RS Principles? If so, how does it meet the principles? If not, which principles does it not meet and why?*

Phone calls, github, google drive file, and google search. They worked well for comminicating and organizing. 

The continuous integration for bug testing was problematic. It seems like it couldn't read our files very well. We would have rather tested them old school.

We wouldnt have tried to work on the webscraping as heard as we did. 

The next step in development would have been data analysis.
No our does not mean FAIR4RS, specifically it does not meet the global variable condition, and does not meet community standards.
