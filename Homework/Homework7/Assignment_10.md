## Project description
*A brief description of why you wrote the code, what problem it is trying to address, and anything else you think is relevant to know about your project. This should be about 100 words.*

The manual collecting and sorting of articles presents significant problems in the scholarly world. These problems are a lack of organization in the collection and relevance of articles in the research process, the misrepresentation of an articleâ€™s meaning, and standardization in the formatting and style for publications. Thus, the purpose of this project is to create a workshop to gain familiarity with github and git to that end. As such, the code here is very basic, to handle a simple collection of references, store that in some place, and process it for readiability. In no wise, is the expectation of this code, or rather workshop intended for anything else.

## List of must-have features of your project including their status
*Were you able to complete all basic features? If not, why not? This list should match the list you submitted in assignment 2.*
 1. Get articles and abstracts
 2. Read and sort articles and abstracts by keywords
 3. Output relevant groupings and statistics

No we were not able to complete any of the basic features, because so much of the data is different, and couldnt be accessed reliably. Also, we didn't have enough time.

## List of nice-to-have features of your project including their status
*This list should have at least all features you included in assignment 2, but could have more if you added new features along the way. Nice-to-have features do not have to be completed. They may be in progress or not done yet.*
 1. Create centralized location for sources
 2. Create useful visualizations and identifiers of relevant groupings and statistics
 3. Automate creation of text files from URL

## A reflection of your work on the project.
*The reflection should be about a page long. It should answer the following questions*:
 - *What processes, tools, technologies, and workflows worked well for your team? How did they improve or simplify your team work?*
 
 - *What processes, tools, technologies, and workflows did not work well and why?* 
 
 - *If you would start over, what would you change and why?*
 
 - *If you kept working on the project, what would be the next step in its development?*
 
 - *Does your code meet the FAIR4RS Principles? If so, how does it meet the principles? If not, which principles does it not meet and why?*
Project Reflection: Team Summary

Over the course of our project, we, as a team, have navigated a variety of challenges and successes. Reflecting on our journey, we recognize the pivotal role played by our chosen processes, tools, and methodologies in shaping our workflow and outcomes.

Effective Practices and Tools:

Communication and Collaboration: Our use of phone calls and Google Drive proved invaluable. These tools streamlined our communication, ensuring that all team members stayed informed and engaged. Google Drive, in particular, was instrumental in organizing our documents and resources, allowing for easy access and collaboration.

Version Control with GitHub: GitHub was central to our version control and collaborative coding efforts. It provided a robust platform for tracking changes, managing code versions, and reviewing each other's contributions, thereby enhancing the quality of our collective output.

Areas of Difficulty:

Continuous Integration Struggles: We encountered significant challenges with our continuous integration setup. The system frequently failed to read our files correctly, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In hindsight, a more traditional approach to testing might have been more effective for our specific needs.

Overemphasis on Web Scraping: We initially dedicated a substantial amount of effort to web scraping. However, this focus was perhaps misplaced, considering the limited impact it had on our overall objectives. A more balanced approach to task prioritization would likely have yielded better results.

Looking Back: Adjustments for a Restart:

If we were to start over, our primary change would be in our approach to testing and task prioritization. We would integrate a blend of manual and automated testing to overcome the issues we faced with continuous integration. Additionally, we would reassess our task distribution, ensuring that each aspect of the project aligns more closely with our end goals.

Next Steps and Future Directions:

Moving forward, our focus would shift towards data analysis. Having collected a significant amount of data, the next logical step involves applying analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights, which could potentially lead to impactful conclusions and applications.

Compliance with FAIR4RS Principles:

Our current project framework does not fully comply with the FAIR4RS principles. We acknowledge shortcomings, particularly in terms of global variable usage and non-adherence to community standards. These issues limit the interoperability and reusability of our software. In future iterations, we aim to address these concerns, making our software more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, thereby aligning it more closely with the FAIR4RS principles.
