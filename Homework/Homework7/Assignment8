A list of links to any issues that you think show your progress and any commits, along with an explanation why you picked those contributions. 
I will look at your GitHub repository in any case to see what progress you have made, but if there is anything you think stands out, please point me directly to it.
I expect there to be at least 1 contribution per team member in the form of comments on issues, commits, etc.
Contributions should be meaningfully show progress on the project. A commit that fixes a typo does not count as a meaningful contribution; expanding on the readme by adding the coding conventions you plan to employ does count.
A list of any issues that you were able to complete and close.
At this point, you ideally getting closer to be finished with your "must have" issues. However, there is no strict requirement for how many issues you should have closed by now for this assignment.
